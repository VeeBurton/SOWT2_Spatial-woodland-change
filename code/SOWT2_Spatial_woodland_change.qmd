### The question(s)

1. Is woodland loss compromising gains from creation?
  a. What's causing loss?

  c. What are the time lags associated with this?

### Data required

* NFI - spatial
* Woodland loss (GFW) - spatial
* Restocking data - Forestry Statistics - not spatial, Subcompartment Database (SCDB) - spatial, felling licenses - unsure
* Creation data - Forestry Statistics - not spatial, grant scheme data - spatial
